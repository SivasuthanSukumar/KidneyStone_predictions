"Kidney Stone Prediction Using Machine Learning: Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN"
The "Kidney Stone Prediction" project involves binary classification using machine learning techniques to predict the presence or absence of kidney stones. The project utilizes a tabular dataset obtained from Kaggle, which contains relevant features for the prediction task. By analyzing this data, the project aims to assist in early diagnosis and treatment decisions for kidney stones. Employing methods such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), the model will learn patterns and relationships in the data to make accurate predictions. Ultimately, this project has the potential to improve healthcare outcomes by enabling early intervention for individuals at risk of kidney stones.
